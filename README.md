# Independence

The "Shiny app" will calculate the probably that two binary variables are statistically independent.  To use this, first determine the two binary variables that are under consideration.  For example, you might want to know if what you get when you flip a coin is related to what your friend gets when they flip a different coin.

Let A.TRUE mean that you got a head and A.FALSE represent that you got a tails.
Let B.TRUE mean that your friende got a head and B.FALSE represent that your friend got a tails.

Both you and your friend should flip that coins several times and count the number of times for each of the four categories.  For example, you and your friend might have flipped your coins 100 times and 30 of the times, both you and your friend got heads.  Then the you should put 30 into the textbox for "Count of when both A and B are TRUE."  You should then put the applicable counts into the other three text boxes.

Most of the results will appear dynamically; however, the computation of the "Probability that A & B are independent" requires that at least one count must be greater than 0.
